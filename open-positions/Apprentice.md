Not everyone has a clear path to a job in tech industry. It can be particularly difficult for individuals with non-traditional work and educational backgrounds to find full-time roles. For every computer science graduate we hire, we know there are others who could also make a significant impact: people whose work experience is primarily outside of tech and are looking to pivot into the industry; people who have taken time off for caregiving and are coming back into the workforce. 

Apprenticeship is a way to learn about being a professional software developer. Specifically, it is a way to learn to be like the most skilled software developers you can find. It involves seeking out good teachers, and taking opportunities to learn by working alongside them. It is the first step on the road toward becoming a different kind of software professional—one who wants to be more than just competent.

With this in mind, we’re proud to launch our Craftsmen Apprenticeship Program. 

# The Program

Getting inspired by Github, our Craftsmen Apprenticeship is a 10-week paid career development program tailored to support individuals with non-traditional work and educational backgrounds. While we already have a successful internship program for full-time college students, this Craftsmen Apprenticeship was designed for people who wish to take a higher step in the industry,to help them gain the knowledge, tools, and skills to better make their way into the software engineer career path.

# About Us

Found in 2014, Dwarves Foundation is an innovation service firm. [We stand for the craftsmanship](/additional-info/what-we-stand-for.md) in software development. Our woodland is a sum of great technology, engineering culture, and smart people. The numbers speak for themselves:

- 50 talented members
- 10 common team size per deployments

# The Plan

You will spend the first two weeks for training. At the end of your second week, you'll meet with your Director to discuss your current state and the plan for what's next.

The next eight weeks are where the exicitng part dives in. You get to roll up the sleeve, get your hands on the real projects, apply your best practices on the work and bring them to a different level. 

There will be a weekly review and retrospective meeting to make sure you are on the right track and get closer to your final goal. We can't ensure whether or not it will end flawlessly, but trust us, the ride is enjoyable.

Pairing is the fastest and most effective way to learn, so it should be a priority for you and your mentor. However, do not expect to pair 100% of the time. One particularly effective method of pairing is Ping-Ponging. The idea is for Person 1 to write a test, Person 2 writes the code to make the test pass. Then Person 2 writes the next test and Person 1 writes the code to make the test pass. Rinse, repeat.

We also encourage you to pair with other apprentices as well as with other Dwarves who are not your mentor. Everyone on the team loves teaching and learning, and they'd love to teach and learn from you. A good way to do it is to announce during standup that you're looking for someone to pair with, and if people have free time (usually only Fridays, since that's when everyone gets a break from client work), they'll tell you.
